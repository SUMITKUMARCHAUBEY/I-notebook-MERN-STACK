# I-notebook-MERN-STACK
This is a full satck web developement project
There is a node js server setup in the backend folder and the 
react front-end is present in the my-app folder.

I-notebook is a basic crud application with user authentication and autherization facility.
The user autherization is done using jwt.

To setup the project you will have to creat your own mongoDB database and store your data base 
URL in the .env file in the "DB_URI" globle variable, and for the jwt to work you will have to 
creat a secret key and store it into the .env file in the "secret" globle variable.
